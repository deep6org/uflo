# binaural-bci-walkman
Binaural audio agent for brain computer interfaces

## buh why?
.. Probably becuase I'd like to walk through nature with an adaptive stream of binaural beats for maximal perceptual learning interfacing to tuned flow states.

## Experimental Approach
Hacking it

## Technologies Used
- websockets
- pytorch
- blueberry bci
- supercollider / scynth audio server
- rasberry pi

## Architecture
