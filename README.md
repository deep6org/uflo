# uflo
A binaural beat toolkit for collective consciousness used by the modern [steersman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Navigator).

# Inspiration
While many are focusing on complex synthesis of sounds, this project aims to systematic use audio as a digital accelerant for rotational perspective shifts when meditating, going for a walk, or, as on overlay to any experience.

Binaural Beats are essentially an auditory illusion in that a new sound is perceived which is not presented. For example listening to binaural beats improves frequency detection (perceptual learning).

The goal: augment ones practice to uncover new states through an objective medium of measurement. How? Subtle signal assistance.

Steersman: Navigators are able to use a limited form of prescience to safely navigate interstellar space.
Cybernetics: The scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.

The tool is meant to simulate a [Hadamard gate](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/hadamard/) used in quantum computing, but for ones mind. Hadamard gates create a superposition point between 2 basis states (e.g. frequencies) whereby one is able to expand the possibilities of environmental navigation through optimal perceptual learning and action.

## Modes of Play
* Single: Following single trajectory tuned to neurofeedback
* Layered: Adding Sound dimensions for optimal composition
* Multiplayer: TODO - p2p connected soundscape group meditative experience 

### Technologies Used
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Supercollider / scynth](https://supercollider.github.io/)
* [Blueberryx brain-computer-interface](https://www.blueberryx.com/)
* [Rasberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

### Philosophy
Open sourcing the concept was the first intention. 

Second, documented experimentation via community building around consiousness explorers and the livecoding ecosystem.

Signal-Oriented Programming: Signal programming is used in the same sense as dataflow programming, a signal is meant to represent a synchronous flow of data interrupted by an operating system. 

Specific goal for a device - somewhere between a kindle & phone, like a pokedex but for our world - to capture thoughts, privately, on a walk. Single copy that I can share once connected, if need be with a level of pseudo-anonymity. Something that augments the embodied, not so much as a void / hole for attention capture.

### Design
Alternative model for mindful computing.

Songs are generated on device and saved as a text file. E.g. kilobytes vs. MB, a scale of 10x in storage reduction.

### Process
parts, setup, etc.

### Development Status
What begain as a concept at an [EthGlobal hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/yourflow), winning a prize for trustless compute with neurofeedback, seeded the concept for further exploration in the design process.

Currently under active development
