# uflo
A binaural beat toolkit for collective consciousness used by the moden [steersman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Navigator).

# Inspiration
While many are focusing on complex synthesis, this project aims at various only a few variables to be used as a digital accelerant for rotational perspecrive shifts. 

Binaural beats are essentially an auditory illusion, in that a new sound is perceived which is not presented . Some of the effects you see listed in the wikipedia article are not surprising, for example listening to binaural beats improves frequency detection (perceptual learning).

The tool is meant to simulate a hadamard gate used in quantum computing.

## Modes of Play
* Single: Following single trajectory tuned to neurofeedback
* Layered: Adding Sound dimensions for optimal composition
* Multiplayer: TODO - p2p connected soundscape group meditative experience 

### Technologies Used
* pytorch
* supercollider / scynth
* blueberrytech brain-computer-interface: https://www.blueberryx.com/
* rasberry pi
* socket.io

### Philosophy
Open sourcing the concept was the first intention. Second, community building around the livecoding ecosystem.

Signal-Oriented Programming. While an initial hypothesis as to how we think about computation stems from control of objects. 

Specific goal for a device - somewhere between a kindle & phone, like a pokedex but for our world - to capture thoughts, privately, on a walk. Single copy that I can share once connected, if need be with a level of pseudo-anonymity. Something that augments the embodied, not so much as a void / hole for attention capture.

### Design
Alternative model for calm computing.

Songs are generated on device and saved as a text file. E.g. kilobytes vs. MB, a scale of 10x storage.

### Hardware Device Examples
