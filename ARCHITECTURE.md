# Architecture Abstraction: Multi-Tiered

Considering the cross hash, is meant to mimic a constrained version of how a reverse fourier transform works. The subtle agent guidance by varying based on neurofeedback measurement creates more plasticity in the way the brain 'accepts' tone and sound via systematic constraints.



The guided sound 'waves' amount to a layered sound the user will listen to based on relative agent reward response.

# Architecture Abstraction: Single Trajectory

In the single trajectory, the agent only acts on the tuning of a single band. The variation of frequency of the band dictates the 3rd binaural sound perceived.

```
frequency hz ranges

~delta = 1;     // 0.5 - 2. deep sleep, unsconsciousness
~theta = 5.5;   // 4 - 7. Meditative, drowsy, sleeping. Memory, spatial learning
~mu = 9;        // 9 - 11. associated with voluntary movement
~alpha = 10;    // 7.5 - 12.5. Relaxed states of mind
~beta1 = 14;    // 12.5 - 16. Normal waking consciousness
~beta2 = 18;    // 16.5 - 20.
~beta3 = 24;    // 20.5 - 28
~gamma = 35;    // 32 - 100. Visual awareness, transcendental mental states
```
